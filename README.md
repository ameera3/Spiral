## Introduction

The command line program, spiral.cpp, asks the user for a positive integer n. It then prints
out an n x n array with the numbers 1 through n^2 in a spiral fashion. For example, if n=3,
the output of the program is

1 2 3

8 9 4

7 6 5

If n = 4, the output of the program is 

01 02 03 04

12 13 14 05

11 16 15 06

10 09 08 07
